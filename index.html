            <h2>Ayurveda</h2>
            <P>Ayurveda is an ancient system of natural healing that originated in India. It focuses on balancing the mind, body, and spirit using diet, herbal remedies, and lifestyle practices. Its goal is to promote overall health and prevent disease through personalized treatments.</P>
        <h3>About us Ayurveda</h3>
        <p>Ayurveda is believed to have originated over 5,000 years ago in India, making it one of the oldest healing systems in the world. It is deeply rooted in the Vedic traditions and was first documented in the ancient texts called the Vedas, particularly the Atharvaveda. Early texts like the Charaka Samhita and Sushruta Samhita further developed its principles and treatments. Ayurveda was passed down through oral tradition and later compiled into written works around 1000 BCE. It integrates elements of philosophy, medicine, and spirituality. The system emphasizes balance within the body and nature, often considering a person's unique constitution (dosha). Over time, Ayurveda spread to neighboring regions like Tibet, Sri Lanka, and Southeast Asia. Today, it is practiced worldwide as a holistic approach to health and wellness.</p>
